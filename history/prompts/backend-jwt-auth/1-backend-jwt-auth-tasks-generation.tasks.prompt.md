# Backend JWT Auth Tasks Generation

## Prompt Text
```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response Text
Generated comprehensive tasks for the Todo App Backend API with JWT authentication implementation. Created a detailed tasks.md file with 55 individual tasks organized into 9 phases:

- Phase 1: Setup (project initialization)
- Phase 2: Foundational (core infrastructure)
- Phase 3-7: User stories for task management features
- Phase 8: Authentication enforcement
- Phase 9: Polish and cross-cutting concerns

Each task follows the required format with checkboxes, IDs, story labels where appropriate, and specific file paths. The tasks are organized to enable independent implementation and testing of each user story while maintaining proper dependencies.

## Outcome
Successfully generated executable tasks for the backend JWT authentication implementation following the specification and plan requirements.
